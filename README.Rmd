Easy creation of rating inputs in Shiny.

## Features

* Optimized for [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/).
* Possibility to use [fontawesome 6.1.2](https://fontawesome.com/icons) icons as well as user-defined SVG images.
* Possibility to use animations from [Animate.css](https://animate.style/).
* Simple definition of the number, size (height and width), type, margin (left and right), color and animation of icons.
* Possibility to add tooltips.
* Read only, hover and accumulation modes.
* Possibility to define individual setting rules for icons.
* Compatible with server validation of inputs based on [shinyvalidate](https://rstudio.github.io/shinyvalidate) package.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ShinyRating from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mhanf/ShinyRating")
```
## Example

ShinyRating exports two main functions: `ratingInput()` and `updateRatingInput()`. 

A Shiny app example using these functions can be created as follows:

``` {r installation, eval=FALSE}
# libraries
library(shiny)
library(ShinyRating)
library(bslib)
# ui part
ui <- function(){
  fluidPage(
    theme = bslib::bs_theme(
      version = 5,
      bootswatch = "flatly"
    ),
    br(),
    fluidRow(
      column(
        width = 12,
        align = "center",
        br(),
        ratingInput(
          inputId = "mood",
          label = "How do you feel ?",
          cumul = FALSE,
          hover = TRUE,
          i_on_color = c("danger","warning","dark","info","success"),
          i_off_color = "light",
          i_name = c("face-angry","face-frown","face-meh","face-smile","face-laugh"),
          i_lib = "fontawesome",
          i_anim = "pulse",
          tlp = TRUE,
          tlp_color = c("danger","warning","dark","info","success"),
          tlp_position = "bottom",
          i_value = c("Angry","Frown","Neutral","Happy","Excited")
        ),
        br(),
        ratingInput(
          inputId = "star",
          label = "Where is shinyRating on the fun scale ?",
          i_anim = "tada",
          i_name = "star",
          i_on_color = "#D5AB55",
          cumul = TRUE,
          hover = TRUE
        ),
        br(),
        actionButton("reset","Reset",class="btn-success m-1"),
        actionButton("update","Update",class="btn-success m-1"),
        br(),
        textOutput("rating1"),
        textOutput("rating2")
      )
    )
  )
}
# Server part
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  observeEvent( 
    input$reset , {
      updateRatingInput(session, "star")
      updateRatingInput(session, "mood")
    }
  )
  observeEvent( 
    input$update , {
      updateRatingInput(session, "star",value = 5)
      updateRatingInput(session, "mood", value = "Excited")
    }
  )
  observe({
    output$rating1 <- renderText(paste0("response 1: ",input$mood))
    output$rating2 <- renderText(paste0("response 2: ",input$star))
    })
}
# launch the app
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

You can run a gallery with :

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
ShinyRating::run_gallery()
```

A live version is available [here](https://mhanf.shinyapps.io/shinyRating/).

## Prior art & philosophy

The core functionnalities of this package are similar to those of the [ShinyRatingInput](https://github.com/stefanwilhelm/ShinyRatingInput). This package tries to overcome some limitations by being optimized for [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) and compatible with the shinyverse packages developed by Rstudio (mostly [shinyvalidate](https://rstudio.github.io/shinyvalidate/), [bslib](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/) and [fontawesome](https://github.com/rstudio/fontawesome)) as well as extending its functionnalities (color, size, animation ...). The tooltip functionality is inspired from the one of the [bsutils](https://github.com/JohnCoene/bsutils) package. SVG loading functionnalities are strongly inspired from the ones of [icons](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/icons) package.The idea to use [animate.css](https://animate.style/) comes from the [shinyanimate](https://github.com/Swechhya/shinyanimate) package.
